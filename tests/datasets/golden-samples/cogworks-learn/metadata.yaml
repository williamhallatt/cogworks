# Purpose: Regression testing baseline for minimal, clean skill

skill_slug: cogworks-learn
sample_type: golden
quality_tier: excellent
description: Minimal skill covering Claude Code skill authoring - SKILL.md structure, frontmatter, invocation modes, context management, best practices

# Expected Layer 1 Results
layer1_expected:
  status: pass
  critical_failures: 0
  warnings: 0
  checks_passed: 10
  line_count: 75
  citation_count: 3

# Layer 2 Expected (not yet implemented)
layer2_expected:
  status: pending
  overall_score: null
  weighted_score: null
  dimensions: null

# Tolerance Levels for Regression Testing
tolerance:
  line_count: 5  # ±5 lines acceptable (smaller skill, tighter tolerance)
  citation_count: 1  # ±1 citation acceptable
  warnings: 0  # Should remain at 0
  score_percentage: 5  # ±5% for LLM-judge scores

# Quality Benchmarks
quality_benchmarks:
  why_golden: |
    - Minimal, focused skill (75 lines)
    - Clean pass with zero warnings
    - Efficient use of inline context
    - Demonstrates minimal viable skill structure
    - Perfect for testing baseline functionality

  expected_characteristics:
    - All deterministic checks pass
    - Zero warnings (perfect score)
    - Complete frontmatter
    - Minimal but sufficient citations (3)
    - Compact, efficient structure

# Test Composition
test_cases:
  structural:
    - "SKILL.md exists and is readable"
    - "Valid YAML frontmatter with required fields"
    - "Line count well within limit (75/500)"
    - "Sufficient citations for compact skill"

  content:
    - "No supporting files (inline context)"
    - "No forbidden patterns"
    - "Description is concise and clear"

  format:
    - "No duplicate headers"
    - "Valid markdown syntax"
    - "Clean JSON output"

# Regression Detection Scenarios
regression_detection:
  critical_regressions:
    - "Critical failures increase from 0 to any value"
    - "Status changes from pass to fail"
    - "Citations drop below 3"
    - "Any warnings appear"

  warning_regressions:
    - "Warnings increase from 0 to any value"
    - "Line count increases by >5"

  acceptable_changes:
    - "Line count minor fluctuations (±5)"
    - "Citation count minor changes (±1)"

# Usage Notes
usage_notes: |
  This golden sample represents a minimal, perfectly clean skill with zero warnings.
  Use for regression testing baseline functionality and to verify that minimal skills
  pass without issues.

  Expected behavior:
  - Always passes with zero warnings
  - Stable minimal line count (~75 ±5)
  - Maintains minimal but sufficient citations (3 ±1)

  Regression testing:
  bash scripts/test-generated-skill.sh --skill-path .claude/skills/cogworks-learn
