# Good Code Writing Practices

## Write Clear Code

Code should be easy to read and understand. Use descriptive variable names and add comments where necessary.

```javascript
// Bad
const x = 5;

// Good
const maxRetryAttempts = 5;
```

## Keep Functions Small

Functions should do one thing and do it well. If a function is getting too long, break it into smaller functions.

## Use Meaningful Names

Variable names should describe what they contain. Function names should describe what they do.

## Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

If you find yourself writing the same code multiple times, extract it into a function or module.

## Write Tests

Every function should have tests that verify it works correctly. Test both happy paths and edge cases.

## Handle Errors Gracefully

Always check for errors and handle them appropriately. Don't let exceptions crash your application.

## Comment Your Code

Add comments to explain why you're doing something, not what you're doing. The code itself should show what.

## Use Version Control

Always use git for your projects. Commit often with meaningful commit messages.

## Review Your Code

Before submitting, review your own code. Look for bugs, unclear logic, and opportunities for improvement.

## Keep Learning

Technology changes rapidly. Stay up-to-date with best practices and new tools.
