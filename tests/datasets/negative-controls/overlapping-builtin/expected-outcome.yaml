# Expected Outcome: Overlapping Built-in Knowledge

## Scenario Description
Source material contains only generic coding advice that Claude already knows from training data.

## Expected Behavior
The cogworks workflow should:
1. Detect that content overlaps with built-in knowledge
2. Flag low novelty score during synthesis
3. Suggest reconsidering whether skill is needed
4. Warn that skill may not add value

## Expected Warnings
should_warn: true
warning_type: "overlapping_builtin"
warning_messages:
  - contains: "generic"
  - contains: "built-in knowledge"
  - contains: "may not add value"

## Expected Recommendation
recommendation: "RECONSIDER"
reason: "Content duplicates Claude's general training"

## Validation Criteria
If skill is generated despite warning:
- No overlap score should be low (≤3)
- Self-sufficiency might be high (content is clear)
- But overall value justification should fail
- Overall score may pass structurally but fail on novelty

Expected scores:
  no_overlap: 2  # Significant overlap
  value_justification: false
  recommendation: "RECONSIDER"

## Test Case
```jsonl
{"id": "neg-002", "type": "negative_control", "scenario": "overlapping_builtin", "expected_outcome": "suggest_reconsider", "no_overlap_score_max": 3}
```

## Purpose
Validates that the framework identifies when a skill would duplicate Claude's existing knowledge, preventing unnecessary skills that don't add value.

## False Positive Risk
**Low** - Generic advice like "write clear code" is definitively in Claude's training.

If sources contained:
- Organization-specific coding standards
- Tool-specific best practices
- Non-obvious insights

Then it would NOT be overlapping and should pass.
