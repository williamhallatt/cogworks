# Expected Outcome: Insufficient Sources

## Scenario Description
Source material contains only ~30 words - insufficient to create a meaningful skill.

## Expected Behavior
The cogworks workflow should:
1. Detect sparse content during synthesis
2. Warn user that content is insufficient
3. Suggest adding more comprehensive sources
4. Offer to proceed anyway (not recommended) or abort

## Expected Warnings
should_warn: true
warning_type: "insufficient_sources"
warning_messages:
  - contains: "sparse"
  - contains: "insufficient"
  - contains: "more comprehensive"

## Expected Recommendation
recommendation: "RECONSIDER"
should_proceed_by_default: false

## Validation Criteria
If skill is generated despite warning:
- Source fidelity score should be low (≤3)
- Completeness score should be low (≤3)
- Overall score should be <0.75 (FAIL)

## Test Case
```jsonl
{"id": "neg-001", "type": "negative_control", "scenario": "insufficient_sources", "expected_outcome": "warn_user", "should_fail_if_generated": true}
```

## Purpose
Validates that the framework can identify when source material is too sparse to create a valuable skill, preventing low-quality skill generation.
