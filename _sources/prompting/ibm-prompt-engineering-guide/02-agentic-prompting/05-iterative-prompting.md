## Overview

Iterative prompting is "a structured, step-by-step approach in prompt engineering designed to refine and optimize interactions with large language models." Rather than static prompts, this methodology uses feedback loops to continuously improve AI responses across multiple domains.

## Core Process

The technique operates through four stages:

1. **Initial prompt creation** - Establishing clear task definition and expected outputs
2. **Model response evaluation** - Assessing accuracy, relevance, and alignment with objectives
3. **Prompt refinement** - Modifying instructions based on identified gaps
4. **Feedback incorporation** - Iterating until outputs meet quality standards

## Key Benefits

The approach delivers:
- Enhanced accuracy through clarified instructions
- Optimized reasoning for complex tasks
- Reduced hallucinations and factual inconsistencies
- Production-ready outputs without additional computational resources
- Domain-specific and tone-adapted responses

## Best Practices

The article emphasizes six core strategies:

- Start with minimal prompts, adding complexity gradually
- Maintain detailed version records for reproducibility
- Use quantitative metrics combined with human evaluation
- Prevent scope drift during refinement cycles
- Define clear convergence criteria to avoid over-processing
- Test multiple prompt variations simultaneously

## Applications

Practical use cases span sales analytics, customer support chatbots, automated reporting, content creation, and adaptive educational systems. A detailed example demonstrates how sales reports progressively evolve from generic summaries into actionable strategic insights through systematic refinement.
