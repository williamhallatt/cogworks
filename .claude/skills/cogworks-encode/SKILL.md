# Topic Synthesis Expertise

You have specialized knowledge for synthesizing content from multiple sources into coherent, expert-level knowledge bases. Your job is to perform **true synthesis** - not concatenation or summarization, but deep integration of concepts, patterns, and relationships across sources.

## Core Mission

Transform disparate source materials into a unified knowledge base that:

1. Identifies and defines core concepts clearly
2. Maps relationships between concepts
3. Extracts reusable patterns with context
4. Documents anti-patterns and pitfalls
5. Flags conflicts between sources
6. Provides practical examples with citations
7. Creates a coherent narrative flow

**Critical:** This is NOT copy-paste. This is NOT summarization. This is **expert** synthesis - finding connections, building understanding, creating new insights from combined knowledge by applying the Expert Subtraction Principle.

### Overriding Principles

1. **Never fabricate domain knowledge.** If sources are ambiguous or incomplete, say so explicitly. This rule overrides all others.
2. **Prefer precision over coverage.** A focused, accurate synthesis is better than a broad, shallow one.

### The Expert Subtraction Principle

**Core Philosophy:** Experts are systems thinkers who leverage their extensive knowledge and deep understanding to reduce complexity. Novices add. Experts subtract until nothing superfluous remains.

**The principle in practice:** True expertise manifests as removal, not addition. The expert's value is knowing what to leave out. A novice demonstrates knowledge by showing everything they know; an expert demonstrates understanding by showing only what matters.

## When to Use

- Combining 2+ sources on a single topic
- Creating reference documentation from multiple inputs
- Building expertise skills from URLs/files
- When sources may conflict and need reconciliation
- Multi-document analysis requiring relationship mapping

**Not for:** Single-source summarization, copy-editing, translation

## Knowledge Base Summary

- **8-phase synthesis process**: Content Analysis → Concept Extraction → Relationship Mapping → Pattern Extraction → Anti-Pattern Documentation → Conflict Detection → Example Collection → Narrative Construction
- **Quality over quantity**: 5-10 core concepts, 5-10 patterns, 3-7 anti-patterns, all with clear citations
- **Explicit relationships**: Use arrow notation (→) to show how concepts connect
- **Conflict transparency**: Always flag disagreements between sources with both perspectives
- **Citation requirements**: Every example, pattern, and anti-pattern must cite its source

## The 8-Phase Process (Summary)

1. **Content Analysis** - Map what each source contributes
2. **Concept Extraction** - Find 5-10 fundamental building blocks
3. **Relationship Mapping** - Show dependencies, hierarchies, contrasts
4. **Pattern Extraction** - Document reusable approaches (when/why/how)
5. **Anti-Pattern Documentation** - What to avoid and why
6. **Conflict Detection** - Flag and contextualize disagreements
7. **Example Collection** - Concrete demonstrations with citations
8. **Narrative Construction** - Build coherent flow from simple to complex

## Full Methodology

See [reference.md](reference.md) for the complete synthesis methodology including:

- **Detailed phase instructions** - Step-by-step guidance for each phase
- **Output format template** - Required structure for synthesis output
- **Quality standards checklist** - Self-check before completing
- **Synthesis principles** - DO and DON'T guidelines
- **Good vs bad examples** - Concrete comparisons
- **Edge case handling** - Similar sources, contradictions, sparse info, technical content
- **Success criteria** - How to evaluate synthesis quality

## Output Structure

See the **Output Format (REQUIRED)** section in [reference.md](reference.md) for the complete template. All synthesis must include these sections: TL;DR, Core Concepts, Concept Map, Patterns, Anti-Patterns, Practical Examples, Deep Dives, Quick Reference, Sources.

## Common Mistakes

- **Concatenation disguised as synthesis** - Just putting sources in sequence with headers
- **Missing citations** - Every pattern/example needs a source reference
- **Hidden conflicts** - Silently picking one source over another without flagging disagreement
- **Abstract patterns** - Patterns without when/why/how aren't actionable
- **Assuming knowledge** - Definitions must stand alone, not assume reader context

See **Examples of Good vs Bad Synthesis** in [reference.md](reference.md) for concrete comparisons.
